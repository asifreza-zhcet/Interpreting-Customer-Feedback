# Interpreting Customers Review

This a an end to end capstone project on Interpreting Customers Review. The source of the data is Amazon Fine Food reviews on [Kaggle](#https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews) website. The project has been divided into 3 parts:
1. Data preporcessing
2. Model Building
3. Model Deployment

Data preporcessing and Model Building has been done using Jupyter Notebbok while Model Deployment has been done using VS Code. The Deployment has been done using Flask framework. 

For model building TFIDF is used for text embedding. A subset of the data (20%) has been used for model building. A video has been added for better understanding.
